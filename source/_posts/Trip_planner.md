Wondered! If you are going to plan a trip and want to see different cities on the map and the usual route. I have prepared a very simple
RShiny Data Visualization app for which gives you a very basic map view of the cities you will be visiting.

How did the idea came?

I was planning for my Vietnam Trip with my family and was confused which cities should I visit first and then in the remaining order.
This can be a crucial thing if you are visiting a country which has around 6-7 cities all over the spread. To save time and money one can have a very quick view of the visualization.

**I have hosted the app on the R Server and below is the link to it:**

You might need to wait for few seconds before it opens.

**Also, link to the codes are shared below:**
[Github Repository](https://github.com/jhawakshay/Trip_Visualization "Trip Visualization")

I will be working adding more features like Temperature, Idea months to visit, Train & Air Services.
Write to akshayjhawar.nitj@gmail.com if you have any suggestion or queries!

Until then keep travelling & keep learning!
